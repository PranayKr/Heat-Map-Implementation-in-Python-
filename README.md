# A Data Analytics(Descriptive Analytics) Project showing Heat Map Implementaion in Industrial Warehouse using Python (Matplotlib-Plotly-Numpy libraries in Anaconda-3 Environment)

  
The Heat Map Concept refers to coloring of the warehouse bins containing products of 
different ranks based upon their demand currently in the market i.e. on the frequency of a
particular product being ordered or the quantity of an ordered product in a certain hour.

The data related to the warehouse bins and products is stored in SQL DB.
The Heat Map logic involves execution of SQL stored procedures to rearrange the bins as per 
The rank of the products contained in them in such a way that the highest ranked products get 
relocated to the shortest distance from the picking stations in the industrial warehouse
